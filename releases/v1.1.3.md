# Release v1.1.3

Release date: 2025-12-29

Highlights
- README fully rewritten in English to document theme structure and blocks.
- Removed automatic view-count tracking and cookie debounce from the Popular Posts module; the block now renders a curated list chosen by editors.
- Version bumped to `1.1.3` and annotated git tag `v1.1.3` created and pushed.

Files changed (not exhaustive)
- `README.md` — replaced with English documentation.
- `inc/popular-posts.php` — removed view-count logic.
- `dist/twentytwentyfive-child/inc/popular-posts.php` — synced removal in distribution copy.
- `package.json` — version bumped to `1.1.3`.

Notes
- `dist/` remains in `.gitignore`; distribution artifacts are produced by `npm run dist`.
