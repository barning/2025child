# Release v1.1.4

Release date: 2025-01-02

Highlights
- **Visual Link Preview:** Changed from async to synchronous metadata fetching to always display rich cards with image/title/description immediately.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Cached `glob()` results in functions.php to avoid repeated filesystem operations on every request.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Added static caching for CSS file existence and modification time checks across all modules (book-rating, popular-posts, visual-link-preview).
- These improvements reduce filesystem I/O operations and improve page load performance.
- Version bumped to `1.1.4` and annotated git tag `v1.1.4` created and pushed.
