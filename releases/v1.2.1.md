# Release v1.2.1

Release date: 2026-01-09

Highlights
- **Video Game block:** Fix undefined array key warnings and validate IGDB API responses; filter invalid games to prevent PHP 8+ notices.
- **Media Recommendation block:** Fix ambilight by waiting for image load and adding safety guards.
- **CI/CD:** Optimize release workflow to reuse artifacts, add release-published trigger, and declare explicit GITHUB_TOKEN permissions.
- **Docs:** Add workflow automation notes to README.

Files changed
- `inc/video-game.php` — harden search handling and comments for game ID filtering.
